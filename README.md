# WeatherApp - Sunshine


Weather Application using Esri Appstudio
UI/UX Design - Adobe XD
Logos and weather images - flaticon

Buisness Logic :
I have built a weather application using App studio. I have used a real-time data using weather API's which will give current weather and forecast of your location.

*There are the three screen with first being the start page of the application showing the logo and name of the wetaher app with a start button to proceed to the application. 

*The second page shows the curent location of the user using location libraries. It also shows the maximum and minimum temperatures.
It also shows additonal information like
--> Wind
--> Humidity
--> Visibility

* On clicking the location buttion the application moves to the thired screen which shows the currwnt location of the user on the map.
