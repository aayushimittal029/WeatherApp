# WeatherApp - Sunshine


Weather Application using Esri Appstudio
UI/UX Design - Adobe XD
Logos and weather images - flaticon

Buisness Logic :
I have built a weather application using App studio. I have used a real-time data using weather API's which will give current weather and forecast of your location.
 <br />

* There are the three screen with first being the start page of the application showing the logo and name of the wetaher app with a start button to proceed to the application. 
 <br />

* The second page shows the curent location of the user using location libraries. It also shows the maximum and minimum temperatures.
 <br />
It also shows additonal information like
 <br />
--> Wind
 <br />
--> Humidity
 <br />
--> Visibility

 <br />
 <br />
* On clicking the location buttion the application moves to the third screen which shows the currwnt location of the user on the map.
