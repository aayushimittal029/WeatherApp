# WeatherApp - Sunshine


Weather Application using Esri Appstudio
UI/UX Design - Adobe XD
Logos and weather images - flaticon

I have built a weather application using App studio. I have used a real-time data using weather API's which will give current weather and forecast of your location.

There are the three screen with first being the start page of the application showing the logo and name of the wetaher app with a start button to proceed to the application 

Buisness Logic :

* The weather application should use the curent location
